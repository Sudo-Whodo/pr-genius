## ‚ú® Features

- üîç Analyzes file changes in pull requests
- üìä Provides detailed statistics (files changed, lines added/deleted)
- üß† Uses OpenRouter AI models (default: Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to:
  - Analyze code changes and their impact
  - Identify potential risks and concerns
  - Suggest improvements
  - Generate documentation updates
- üí¨ Posts formatted summaries as PR comments
- üìö Maintains documentation requirements
- üîê Supports authentication via GitHub token
- üöÄ Available as a GitHub Action

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Create `.github/workflows/pr-analysis.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: PR Analysis
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      contents: read

    steps:
      - name: PR Diff Analysis
        uses: sudo-whodo/pr-genius@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}
          openrouter_key: ${{ secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }}
```

2. Add required secrets to your repository:

   a. Personal Access Token (PAT):

   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
   - Generate new token with:
     - `repo` scope (for repository access)
     - `pull_requests` scope (for commenting on PRs)
   - Add to repository secrets as `PAT_TOKEN`

   b. OpenRouter API Key:

   - Get your API key from https://openrouter.ai/
   - Add to repository secrets as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

That's it! PR Genius will now analyze your pull requests automatically.

## üîß Configuration

### Action Inputs

| Input                 | Description                  | Required | Default                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| `github_token`        | Personal Access Token (PAT)  | Yes      | -                           |
| `openrouter_key`      | OpenRouter API key           | Yes      | -                           |
| `repository`          | Repository name (owner/repo) | No       | Current repository          |
| `pull_request_number` | PR number to analyze         | No       | Current PR number           |
| `model`               | OpenRouter model to use      | No       | anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet |

### Required Permissions

The workflow needs these permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  pull-requests: write # For posting comments
  contents: read # For accessing repository contents
```

Additionally, your PAT_TOKEN must have:

- `repo` scope for repository access
- `pull_requests` scope for commenting on PRs

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

1. **Permission Issues (403 Forbidden)**

   - Ensure you're using PAT_TOKEN, not GITHUB_TOKEN
   - Verify PAT has required scopes (repo, pull_requests)
   - Check that the token hasn't expired

2. **Missing OpenRouter API Key**

   - Ensure you've added the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to your repository secrets
   - Check that the secret name matches exactly

3. **Rate Limits**

   - OpenRouter has rate limits based on your plan
   - GitHub API also has rate limits

4. **Token Security**
   - Never commit tokens directly in workflow files
   - Always use repository secrets
   - Regularly rotate your PAT for security
